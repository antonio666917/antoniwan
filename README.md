Hi! My name is Antonio Rodriguez, and I enjoy leading teams, building software, and learning about anything.

Some years ago, a friend and I founded a web development company and later sold it. The experience was more educational than lucrative. Since then, I've worked as a Chief Technology Officer, as an engineering manager, at the Director-level, and my favorite, as an individual contributor in many projects and products with various levels of effort and impact. Currently, I'm exploring different disciplines and have taken on a Product Owner role at a global tools company.

Aside from work, I put most of my efforts into being a conscious and involved parent, a better husband, and a healthier person.
